    Changes
    =======

    This is a list of MAJOR changes to ComponentJS. For a
    more fine-granular commit-based change information,
    have a look at the version control history under
    https://github.com/rse/componentjs/commits/master
    
    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.5 and 0.9.6
    -------------------------------------------------

    o <component>.subscribe({ origin: true, ... }) functionality was
      removed as the Event object on callbacks has the origin via its
      <ev>.target() method.

    o fixed "exclusive" subcription handling.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.4 and 0.9.5
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Replaced the object validation mechanism of cs.params() and
      cs.model() with a full-blown DSL-based implementation. The most
      notably changes are that a "null" value now matches the type
      "object". Upgrade your source: "array(foo)" is now "[foo*]"

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.3 and 0.9.4
    -------------------------------------------------

    o The 4th argument (DOCUMENT) for ComponentJS.plugin() is now gone.
      Plugins should not need it anyway.

    o Additional internal hooks are provided for plugins.

    o Model default values are initially validated, too.

    o The <script data-symbol="<name>" [...]> functionalit
      was removed as it conflicts with the plugin mechanism.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.2 and 0.9.3
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Refactored out the debugger into its own plugin.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.1 and 0.9.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Added back support for Internet Explorer 8 where a field
      cannot be named "constructor". The cs.clazz/cs.trait field
      is now named "cons". 

    o Added an additional "configured" state which can be used
      to configure subscribe/register/observe/latch operations
      while "prepare" is still intended for loading data.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.0 and 0.9.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Implemented an internal hooking and plugin mechanism and 
      provided two convenient plugins for jQuery and Ext socket support.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.0.0 and 0.9.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Initial functionality
