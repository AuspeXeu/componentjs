    Changes
    =======

    This is a list of MAJOR changes to ComponentJS. For a
    more fine-granular commit-based change information,
    have a look at the version control history under
    https://github.com/rse/componentjs/commits/master

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.7 and 0.9.8
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Improved Debugger plugin: the components in the component tree
      view are now clickable. Once clicked details about the component
      are displayed in the new infobox view which overlays the console
      view. Additionally, the component tree view now provides a zoom
      and scroll functionality in order to allow you to display large
      component trees in a reasonable way, too.

    o Modularized the debugger plugin sources.
    
    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.6 and 0.9.7
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Fixed internal "clazz" parameter validation.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.5 and 0.9.6
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Improved Debugger plugin: the status bar is now grabbable
      to allow you to more precisely control the size of the component
      tree visual display. The background of the visual display, header
      and status bar are now gradient based. Active state transition
      guards are now indicated by partially-overlayed red light bulps
      (rendered only if guards are not at level 0).

    o <component>.subscribe({ origin: true, ... }) functionality was
      removed as the Event object on callbacks has the origin via its
      <ev>.target() method.

    o fixed "exclusive" subcription handling.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.4 and 0.9.5
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Replaced the object validation mechanism of cs.params() and
      cs.model() with a full-blown DSL-based implementation. The most
      notably changes are that a "null" value now matches the type
      "object". Upgrade your source: "array(foo)" is now "[foo*]"

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.3 and 0.9.4
    -------------------------------------------------

    o The 4th argument (DOCUMENT) for ComponentJS.plugin() is now gone.
      Plugins should not need it anyway.

    o Additional internal hooks are provided for plugins.

    o Model default values are initially validated, too.

    o The <script data-symbol="<name>" [...]> functionalit
      was removed as it conflicts with the plugin mechanism.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.2 and 0.9.3
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Refactored out the debugger into its own plugin.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.1 and 0.9.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Added back support for Internet Explorer 8 where a field
      cannot be named "constructor". The cs.clazz/cs.trait field
      is now named "cons". 

    o Added an additional "configured" state which can be used
      to configure subscribe/register/observe/latch operations
      while "prepare" is still intended for loading data.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.0 and 0.9.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Implemented an internal hooking and plugin mechanism and 
      provided two convenient plugins for jQuery and Ext socket support.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.0.0 and 0.9.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Initial functionality
