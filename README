    Elevator Pitch
    ==============

    ComponentJS is a stand-alone MPL-licensed Open Source library
    for JavaScript, providing a powerful Component System for
    hierarchically structuring the User-Interface (UI) dialogs of
    complex HTML5-based Rich Clients (aka Single-Page-Apps) â€” under
    maximum applied Separation of Concerns (SoC) architecture principle,
    through optional Model, View and Controller component roles, with
    sophisticated hierarchical Event, Service, Hook, Model, Socket and
    Property mechanisms, and fully independent and agnostic of the
    particular UI widget toolkit.

    Building
    ========

    The ComponentJS build process is based on Grunt. The following Unix
    tools have to be installed for this. The ComponentJS author uses an
    OpenPKG-based software-stack for this.
