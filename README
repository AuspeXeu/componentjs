    ComponentJS is an MPL-licensed Open Source library for JavaScript,
    providing a powerful Component System for hierarchically structuring
    the User-Interface (UI) dialogs of complex HTML5-based Rich Clients â€”
    with maximum Separation of Concerns, through Model, View and Controller
    component roles, and in a fully UI-toolkit-independent way.
