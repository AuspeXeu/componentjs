    ComponentJS is an MPL-licensed Open Source library for JavaScript,
    providing a powerful Component System for hierarchically structuring
    the User-Interface (UI) dialogs of complex HTML5-based Rich Clients â€”
    with maximum Separation of Concerns, through Model, View and Controller
    component roles, and in a fully UI-toolkit-independent way.

    Building ComponentJS
    ====================

    For building the ComponentJS JavaScript library "component-N.N.N.js"
    with "make all" the following mandatory Unix tools have to
    be installed. The ComponentJS author uses an OpenPKG-based
    software-stack for this. The Unix program names which have to be in
    $PATH are given brackets. The OpenPKG package names which have to be
    installed are given in parenthesis.
