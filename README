    Elevator Pitch
    ==============

    ComponentJS is a stand-alone MPL-licensed Open Source library
    for JavaScript, providing a powerful Component System for
    hierarchically structuring the User-Interface (UI) dialogs of
    complex HTML5-based Rich Clients (aka Single-Page-Apps) â€” under
    maximum applied Separation of Concerns (SoC) architecture principle,
    through optional Model, View and Controller component roles, with
    sophisticated hierarchical Event, Service, Hook, Model, Socket and
    Property mechanisms, and fully independent and agnostic of the
    particular UI widget toolkit.

    Building
    ========

    For building the ComponentJS JavaScript library "component-N.N.N.js"
    with "make all" the following mandatory Unix tools have to
    be installed. The ComponentJS author uses an OpenPKG-based
    software-stack for this. The Unix program names which have to be in
    $PATH are given brackets. The OpenPKG package names which have to be
    installed are given in parenthesis.
